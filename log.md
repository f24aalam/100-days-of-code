# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: May 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the angular tour of heroes tutorial.

**Thoughts**: I know angular from 2016-17, used it with the ionic to build a mobile application but never got the chance to use it for web development and other thing. going to create some other projects in angular with different backend frameworks.
